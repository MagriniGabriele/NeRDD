# NeRDD
Repo for NeRDD dataset, comprising of more than 3.5 hours of spatio-temporally synced RGB-Event drone recordings.

To collect the data, a double-camera single-mount setup has been made, placing side-by-side an HD DVS camera and a standard RGB camera. 
In particular, the event-based camera is a Prophesee EVK4 HD, equipped with an 8mm optic and a Sony IMX636ES sensor. The RGB camera is a Svpro HD camera with varifocal lens and a resolution up to 1280x720 at 30fps.

The resulting dataset comprises 3.5 hours of multimodal recordings (a total of 7 hours of footage) at 30 FPS, divided into 115 different videos. Location and background activity significantly varies across videos. Both modalities have HD resolution (1280 x 720).
